## Implementation Details

### Agents [website](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/)
We have developed agents to enhance the performance of the large language model and reduce hallucination:

- **Calculator Agent**: Improves the AI Assistant's performance in mathematical problem-solving.

- **Python Code Execution Agent**: Allows users to execute Python code directly within the AI Assistant.

- **Time Agent**: Provides the current time and date information.

- **Web Search Agent**: Enables the AI Assistant to search the web for information to answer user queries.

- **CSV Analysis Agent**: Reads CSV files and answers questions based on the data. Recently enhanced to provide advanced plot generation capabilities based on user input.This implementation was carried out to offer users a more transparent and informative experience when interacting with the AI Assistant.

### RAG Pipeline [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401.pdf)
We utilize a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline to extract information from PDF files, enhancing the AI Assistant's ability to understand and respond to user queries. The pipeline leverages open-source embeddings from Hugging Face and the Mistral open-source model for processing the retrieval and generation steps.

## Technologies Used
- Ultra-2 Language Model from AI21 Studio: It powers the conversational capabilities and drives the AI's intelligence.  
- Mixtral 8Ã—7B: Utilized to answer queries based on CSV and PDF files, enhancing data interaction capabilities.   
- Hugging Face Transformers and Embeddings: Crucial components for various NLP tasks, contributing to the AI's intelligence and understanding.  
- Python: Employed for backend logic due to its versatility, extensive libraries, and robust functionality.  
- Streamlit: Utilized to create the user-friendly interface, ensuring an interactive and seamless user experience.  
- Langchain: Used for developing prompts and agents, enriching the AI Assistant's functionality and adaptability.
